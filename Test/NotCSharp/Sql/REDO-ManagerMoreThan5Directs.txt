The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name      |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John      |A          |null      |
|102   |Dan       |A          |101       |
|103   |James     |A          |101       |
|104   |Amy       |A          |101       |
|105   |Anne      |A          |101       |
|106   |Ron       |B          |101       |

Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+

SELECT Name FROM Employee AS t1 JOIN
(SELECT ManagerId FROM Employee GROUP BY ManagerId HAVING COUNT(ManagerId) >= 5) AS t2
ON t1.Id = t2.ManagerId

# Find all manager Ids that have atleast 5 count - ie - SELECT ManagerId FROM Employee GROUP BY ManagerId HAVING COUNT(ManagerId) >= 5
# call this t2
# t2 has all the required manager Ids. We just need to display their names
# that's where t1 comes in, we just match their Ids, ie, t1's Id should match t2's Id and we call out their names
