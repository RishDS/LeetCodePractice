you have a table where you have date, user_id, song_id and count. It shows at the end of each day how many times in her history a user has listened to a given song. So count is cumulative sum. You have to update this on a daily basis based on a second table that records in real time when a user listens to a given song. Basically, at the end of each day, you go to this second table and pull a count of each user/song combination and then add this count to the first table that has the lifetime count. If it is the first time a user has listened to a given song, you won't have this pair in the lifetime table, so you have to create the pair there and then add the count of the last day.


answer
select A.user_id, A.song_id, sum(A.count) as freq from
(
select user_id, song_id, count from SUMMARY
union all
select user_id, song_id, count from DAILY where date = now()
) as A
group by A.user_id, A.song_id


we basically do a union all between summary and daily table [today's date from daily table], lets call this 'A'
now we select user id, song and sum(count) of all A instances (grouped by users, then grouped by songs)
so for each unique user id and for each song for that user id, we will get the count of rows (which is the number of listens)
